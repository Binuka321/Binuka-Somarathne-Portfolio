      Iâ€™m an enthusiastic IT undergraduate at SLIIT with experience in full-stack development. 
      I've contributed to both academic and professional projects using technologies like React.js, Vite, Spring Boot, MongoDB, PHP, and WordPress.

      I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy managing projects from planning to deployment.
